# NSFBiosketch

R markdown file extracts a list of collaborators and affiliations from pubmed for NSF biosketch. 

The main script is the `CollaboratorList.Rmd`, designed for my usage but can be adapted to your name following the instructions in the script. `CollaboratorsNew.xlsx` is a spreadsheet designed to contain new collaborators and add them to the list. The Rmd outputs `CollaboratorList.docx` which contains the collaborators formatted per NSF requrements and `ConflictOfInterest.csv` for the table formatted per NSF requirements.

Additional collaborators may be selected from 

Please use freely, but note that I am not responsible for errors or ommissions that may result.

This is just a first pass with awkward formatting. Any additions and/or edits are welcome! Please comment under issues or email ejfertig@jhmi.edu.
